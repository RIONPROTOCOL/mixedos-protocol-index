## 🔐 MIDOM Enforcement Rules

- Holding the correct amount of MIDOM is **required** for any use of RION-governed infrastructure.
- Holding must be **verifiable on-chain** at the time of usage or deployment.
- Usage without valid MIDOM holding is considered **unlicensed** and subject to enforcement.

---

## 💸 Optional Licensing (Non-token method)

For those unable to use MIDOM token directly, protocol access may be granted via:

- Flat-fee annual license (USD or ETH)
- NFT-based license keys (coming soon)

## 🧠 MIDOM Logic

- MIDOM governs access rights  
- RION enforces protocol logic  
- Mixed OS delivers application infrastructure

Holding MIDOM is your entry point into the RION governance layer.

**MIDOM is the key. RION is the lock. Mixed OS is the engine.**
