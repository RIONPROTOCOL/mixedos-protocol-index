# üõ°Ô∏è RION Enforcement Standard

## Purpose
This document establishes the enforceable licensing terms and protocol access rules for use of the RION Protocol across the Mixed OS ecosystem.

## Enforcement Conditions

Use of any of the following requires a license:
- Smart contract structures modeled on RION Protocol logic
- Vault-based timestamping, file logging, or protocol activation methods matching this system
- Use of MIDOM Token as an access gate or governance trigger
- Replication or adaptation of Mixed OS modular flow

## Required for Use

To legally access or implement any layer of RION Protocol:
- A valid license must be obtained via the protocol index
- MIDOM Token must be held and verifiable on-chain at time of access

## Licensing Methods
- Flat-fee licensing via MIDOM Token Index
- Protocol NFT license keys (coming soon)
- Smart contract signature + hash match enforcement (2025Q3)

## Legal Status
This file and system are timestamped, GitHub-committed, and part of a sovereign protocol governed independently via MIDOM Token logic.

All unlicensed use is subject to protocol enforcement procedures, including asset flagging, public posting, and vault-based claim challenges.
