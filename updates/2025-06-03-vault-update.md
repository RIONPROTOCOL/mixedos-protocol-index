# 🛡️ Mixed OS – June 3 Vault Update

## Key Advancements

- ✅ RION Protocol officially launched.
- ✅ MIDOM Token is now active — governs access to all Mixed OS modules.
- ✅ Protocol enforcement layers under construction:
  - Vault asset templates (NDA, contracts, compliance docs)
  - Licensing rails: modular, fixed-rate, and enforceable by design
  - Smart module metadata begins rollout this week

## Notes
This is not a "drop" — this is **architecture**.

Each post, update, and commit represents enforceable licensing infrastructure.
